										<h2 id="content">1. INCREASED MEMBERSHIP</h2>
										<p>Since taking office in 2011, membership has increased considerably.
As at June, 2011, membership stood at 24,000. The rigorous exercise of recruitment increased membership from 24000 to 42,000 in 2014 and the numbers are increasing. This is a result of strategic focus coupled with commitment and team work by the national executive board members. Currently, the number of members has risen to 52,000 and over 10,000 forms are pending to be added to our membership.</p>

												<h3>2. UNITY AND STABILITY</h3>
												<p>Many Trade Unions are characterized by wrangles, sabotage and divisive politics that lead to unending court battles, member attrition, despondent leadership and low staff morale. The current leadership has demonstrated unity of purpose buoyed by the vision and a mission to accomplish. KUPPET has remained an outstanding Union in its conduct of business.</p>

											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h3>3. FULL TIME SECRETARIES</h3>
												<p>The success of any organisation depends on the leadership structure and management. When the current leadership took over, there were only six (6 ) full time branch executive secretaries. There was need to increase the number of executive secretaries as membership increased at a fast rate. To address this, full time branch executive secretaries has since increased to forty four (44).</p>

												<h3>4. REGULAR DISBURSEMENTS</h3>
												<p>Good financial management practices coupled with accountability mechanisms have facilitated regular disbursement of funds from the secretariat to the branches. The Union has a financial committee which deliberates on all financial matters and this enhances transparency, accountability and service delivery. The head office has continually managed the payroll for all employees at the branches guaranteeing the full operationalisation of the branches.</p>

											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>5. PARTICIPATION ON POLICY ISSUES</h3>

Recently, Education committee on secondary school fees, participation on issues of SMASSE,KUPPET members participated and forwarded their views in the review of Code of conduct and ethics and Code of Regulation for teachers. This approach and open door policy has set a precedent in the participation and sharing of views and opinions by the leadership and members. The Union has participated extensively in the new curriculum formulation, piloting and implementation and the demand for more teachers has been put at the forefront.</p>
